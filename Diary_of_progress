Mission: Change the uniq method from uniq agencies to  I wrote into uniq internally booked items agencies, so we focus on the order item instead of the order agency. This is due to the fact that OBB is both inclick and outclick.

Mission2: create newsletter in HTML form
Hardship - I can't get the subscription mailer to parse the confirm.html.haml instead of the confirm.erb text file. I cannot find where it is specified which view to render. Lucas informed me that in the background, Rails will render whatever name is 'confirm' so by changing the name of the text file, and specifying in the Newsletter subscription model to deliver_now instead of later, we can see the errors immediately instead of queuing it with sidekiq
