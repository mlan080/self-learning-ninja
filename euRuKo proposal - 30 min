euRuKo proposal - 30 min

How this topic came about?
I attended the Ruby on Ice conference last week which inspired me to create this talk.  It was obvious there was a desire to connect with other developers, have meaningful conversations and keep in touch post conference. However, there seemed to be a lack of know-how in doing this.  I took this personally (as a junior, I didn’t have enough technical knowledge or provide enough value to others) however upon speaking to 3 other senior developers, they said they also would’ve liked to keep in touch but didn’t. So I want to inspire a change in the tech community’s mindset and share some practical networking techniques to maximise the takeaway from the conference.

My background
* Only Junior/lady/Asian developer (yes to ticking all diversity boxes) at FromatoB  in Berlin
* Been active part of the Ruby on Rails Community, Rails girls, Rubycorns in 3 different countries - Singapore, Malaysia and Germany
* 2 years as Communications skills consultant for Singapore Government NTUC Largest people Union and Changi Airport.

What my topic is all about?
Connecting with conviction at Conferences. Geek style
Pre conference preparation
* What technical problems is your company facing? Be able to explain your architecture in 2 minutes
* Check the social media (twitter, GitHub) of attendees and target specific people you want to speak to
At the Conference - How to  rock at the ‘hallway track’
*  Circle between groups, work the room, pretend you are the host
* Say hi, what’s the worse that could happen?
*  How to cut the awkward small talk and get straight to the point - ask specific questions eg. ‘Anyone struggling with kubernetes config? I see too many people ask about the company/product, do developers even care? It’s more likely you’ll share technologies than product/industry.
* Have a clear idea what steam of conversation you want to take - Possible steams of conversation - Front end, backend, mobile? What kind of database? What kind of APIs do you provide? JSON? GraphQL
* Add some comedy in your convo - How’s everyone’s SCRUM going! Let’s complain together
Post conference - making long term connections
*  Why is this important - share knowledge, recruiting
* Keep in mind what social media suits you best (LinkedIn, twitter, telegram) - speed and smoothness is everything
* Clarify what you can offer to the relationship, what they can provide you
* Send ’It was great to connect with you’ - tips on things you could say

Why this is important for EuRuko and the Ruby community?
* Aligned with start up contest on twitter - engagement, breaking the ice is obviously important
* Keep the Ruby community excited about the language - keep it alive
* Techniques are applicable straight away at the conference, meetups, encourage more people to share their knowledge that they’ve spent all this time acquiring.
